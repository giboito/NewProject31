        <h1 style="margin-left:50%;"> Sao Paulo </h1>
        <img src="SaoPaulo.jpg" alt="Sao Paulo Skyline" style="height:600px; width:100%;">
        <p> Sao Paulo, located in the southeast of Brazil, is an energetic metropolis, and one of the largest cities in the world by population. It is a diverse city, full of tall buildings, historic architecture, urban areas, and distinct cultures. It is a city where you can find anything at any time - a city that never sleeps. 
 Sao Paulo perfectly combines big city with nature and has all types of experiences to be explored, from a hike in the woods to a sunsiring party on a rooftop. Sao Paulo is known in Brazil as the "city of drizzle" because of its constant rain showers. </p>
